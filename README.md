# README Generator


## Description
This assignment is to start using node.js and the inquirer package to begin understanding how back end development works. For this specific challenge, I've created a README.md generator that prompts a user from the command line to create a README.md file.

## Shout Outs & Citation
In order to create the links and badges for the licenses, I used the following links to dynamically display them on the README.me file

* https://shields.io/
* https://opensource.org/licenses

# Challenge #9 Criteria


## User Story
`AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project`

## Acceptance Criteria
`GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README`

## Deliverables

* GitHub repo containing the applications code

## Walkthrough Video
* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator must be submitted and a link to the video should be included in your README file.
